- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mmbaguette
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m into in computer programming, mobile app development with Flutter, OpenCV computer vision and animation.
- ðŸ‘“ As you can tell from [my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/mmbaguette?tab=repositories "My Projects"), I spend 
      most of my time working on OpenCV-related computer vision programs.
- ðŸ¦‹ Flutter, a mobile app development framework [made by Google](https://flutter.dev "Flutter") is the latest thing I've learned.
- ðŸŒ± I have 3D animation experience using Blender, but now I'm focusing on programming and Adobe Creative Cloud.
