- 👋 Hi, I’m @mmbaguette
- 👀 I’m into in computer programming, mobile app development with Flutter, OpenCV computer vision and animation.
- 👓 As you can tell from [my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/mmbaguette?tab=repositories "My Projects"), I spend most of my time working on OpenCV-related computer vision programs.
- 🦋 Flutter, a mobile app development framework [made by Google](https://flutter.dev "Flutter") is the latest thing I've learned.
- 🎮 Sometimes, I like using Roblox for simple [3D game programming](https://www.roblox.com/games/4859404988/LIVE-Plane-Spotting-at-Toronto-Pearson-Airport)
- 🌱 I have 3D animation experience using Blender, but now I'm focusing on programming and Adobe Creative Cloud.
